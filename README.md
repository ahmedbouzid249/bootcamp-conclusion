The Bootcamp was a game-changer for me.
I'm not only strengthened my technical skills—like JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and working with REST APIs—but also learned to think like a problem solver.
I gained hands-on experience with version control using Git and GitHub,
anbd i learned how to manage project deadlines,and worked in a team environment,
which improved my communication and collaboration skills.
    I'm very ready and excited to take the next step in my career and think critically like a developer.
